## Projects

1.  **[Mean-Variance-Standar Deviation Calculator](./project-1-mean-variance-calculator/)**
    * A function that uses **Numpy** to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, sum) across rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.

2.  **[Demographic Data Analyzer](./project-2-demographic-analyzer/)**
    * A script that analyzes a 1994 census dataset using **Pandas** to answer questions about race, age, education, and salary.

3.  **[Medical Data Visualizer](./project-3-medical-visualizer/)**
    * Visualization of medical examination data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Includes data cleaning, a categorical plot, and a correlation heatmap.

4.  **[Time Series Visualizer](./project-4-time-series-visualizer/)**
    * Analysis and visualization of freeCodeCamp forum page views using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create line plots, bar charts, and box plots that show trends and seasonality.

5.  **[Sea Level Predictor](./project-5-sea-level-predictor/)**
    * A script that uses **Pandas**, **Matplotlib** and **SciPy** to analyze sea level data, plot a scatter chart, and compute two linear regression lines to predict future sea levels.
